LiteSpeed Cache for Drupal 9+
============================

Drupal 9+ is significantly changed from Drupal 7. They have converted from procedural programming to object-oriented programming. Drupal 9+ has a built-in page cache (for static content) and a dynamic page cache for logged in users. The latter basically works as a reverse proxy written in PHP. The built-in proxy is good if you have no other options, however, with the LiteSpeed Cache plugin you will see a great improvement in performance for your Drupal 9+ site.

See https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/cache-plugins for more information.

**Clear Cache**

* Clear this site

This option only clears the current Drupal installation. This helps if you have multiple Drupal installations on the same virtual host.

* Clear all

This button clears the entire LiteSpeed cache for this virtual host. This includes any other web apps using LSCache (WordPress, XenForo, etc.) on this vhost.

**Debug**

If turned on, LiteSpeed Cache will emit extra headers for testing while developing or deploying.

**Public Cache TTL**

Amount of time LiteSpeed web server will save pages in the public cache.
